## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Overall, our multiple regression model is somewhat effective at predicting the miles per gallon of MechaCar prototypes.

The p-value for the model is 5.35e-11, or 0.0000000000535, thus the model is 


"When an intercept is statistically significant, it means there are other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in quarter-mile time that have not been included in our model."
